This folder includes the output files generated by the project, while using the example datasets of folder [data](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/UMIc/tree/master/data). It consists of three subfolders:
- UMIc_output_case1
- UMIc_output_case2
- UMIc_output_case3

Each one of them includes the output fastq files for each one of the three library cases described in detail in the [Method](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/UMIc/wiki/Method) page.
- UMIc_output_case1: paired end libraries, UMI in Read1
- UMIc_output_case2: paired end libraries, UMI in Read1 and Read2 
- UMIc_output_case3: single end libraries, UMI in Read1

Each subfolder icludes also a csv file with all the information of the output fastq files and extra information, that can help return from the output sequences to their corresponding input sequences.

For more information about the output files, refer to the [Running the project](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/UMIc/wiki/Running-the-project) page.
