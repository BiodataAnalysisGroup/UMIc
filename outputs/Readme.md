## Results folder

This folder contains all output files generated by the project. The related input datasets can be found in [data](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/UMIc/tree/master/data) folder. 

There are three subfolders, each one of them including the output `fastq` files for each one of the three library cases as described in the [Method](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/UMIc/wiki/Method) page:

- **UMIc_output_case1**: paired end libraries, UMI in Read1
- **UMIc_output_case2**: paired end libraries, UMI in Read1 and Read2 
- **UMIc_output_case3**: single end libraries, UMI in Read1

In each subfolder, a *csv* file is also included with all the information regarding the output fastq files, that can help return to their original input sequences.

For more information about the output files, refer to the [Running the project](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/UMIc/wiki/Running-the-project) page.
