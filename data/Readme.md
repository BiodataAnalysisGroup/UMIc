This folder includes the datasets used to test the project. It consists of three subfolders:
- case1
- case2
- case3

Each one of them includes fastq input files to test the performance of the framework for each one of the three library cases described in detail in the [Method](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/UMIc/wiki/Method) page.
- case1: paired end libraries, UMI in Read1
- case2: paired end libraries, UMI in Read1 and Read2 
- case3: single end libraries, UMI in Read1

Each subfolder icludes also a Readme.md file with the parameter values, used to generate the output files.
