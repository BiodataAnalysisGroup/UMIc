## Sample input datasets

This folder contains sample datasets for testing the project. Each one of them includes `fastq` input files to test the performance of the framework for each one of the three library cases described in detail in the [Method](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/UMIc/wiki/Method) page.

There are three different case scenarios:

- **case1**: paired end libraries, UMI in Read1
- **case2**: paired end libraries, UMI in Read1 and Read2 
- **case3**: single end libraries, UMI in Read1

Each subfolder icludes a *README.md* file with all parameters, used to generate the output files.
